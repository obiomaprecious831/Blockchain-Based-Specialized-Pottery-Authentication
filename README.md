# Blockchain-Based Specialized Pottery Authentication

A decentralized system for authenticating handcrafted pottery through verification of artists, techniques, firing processes, and ownership provenance.

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based authentication system for artisanal pottery, providing a transparent and immutable record for ceramic works. The system consists of four primary contract components:

1. **Artist Verification**: Validates the identity and credentials of ceramic artists
2. **Technique Documentation**: Records the specific methods used in creating each piece
3. **Firing Verification**: Documents kiln conditions and firing processes
4. **Provenance Tracking**: Maintains chain of custody from creation through each owner

## Core Components

### Artist Verification Contract
- Validates the credentials and identity of pottery artists
- Provides unique digital identifiers for verified ceramicists
- Maintains reputation metrics based on training, exhibitions, and career history

### Technique Documentation Contract
- Records specific pottery creation methods (wheel-thrown, hand-built, slip cast)
- Documents clay body composition and source materials
- Captures glazing techniques and surface treatments

### Firing Verification Contract
- Documents kiln type (electric, gas, wood, raku, etc.)
- Records temperature curves, atmosphere conditions, and firing duration
- Verifies special processes like reduction, oxidation, or alternative firing techniques

### Provenance Contract
- Tracks ownership history from creator to current owner
- Documents transfers between parties
- Links physical pieces to their digital certificates through unique identifiers

## Getting Started

[Installation instructions, configuration details, and deployment guidelines would be included here]

## Use Cases

- Collectors can verify the authenticity and complete history of ceramic works
- Artists can protect their techniques and craftsmanship
- Galleries can ensure proper attribution and provenance
- Museums can document complete creation processes for archival purposes

## Future Development

- Integration with physical identifiers (embedded NFC, unique glaze markers)
- Expansion to include collaborative works with multiple artists
- Development of educational resources documenting traditional techniques
- Integration with ceramic exhibition and marketplace platforms
